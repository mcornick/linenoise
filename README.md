# linenoise

__linenoise__ is a Go library that generates strings of random characters (herein called a "noise") that can be used as reasonably secure passwords.

Please see the full documentation in the `docs` directory, also available at https://mcornick.com/linenoise/.

linenoise 1.0.x and 1.1.x are stable. There will be no new features added to linenoise 1.x.x. New features may be added in a 2.0.x branch, if I think of any, but I have none planned right now.

linenoise is available as open source under the terms of the MIT License.
